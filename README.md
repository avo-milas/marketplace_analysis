- Some data analysis can be found in Jupyter notebooks in `basic_analysis` and `visualization`

- `advanced_visualization` presents visualization with Plotly and Dash. In order to run Dash web-framework, one could run `main.py` in IDE - `VS Code`, for instance. In comments bellow local address can be obtained (it looks like 'Dash is running on http://127.0.0.1:8050/')
